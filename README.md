# music-generation-ai
This project is about building a Music Generation Model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory networks) trained on MIDI files. The model learns patterns of notes, timings, and sequences from real music and then generates new short pieces of music.

Input: MIDI music dataset (from Kaggle or other sources).

Process: Train an LSTM network on sequences of notes.

Output: New music (in MIDI format) that can be played back as audio.

This project demonstrates how Deep Learning can be applied to creative tasks like composing music üéº.


Features

Preprocesses MIDI files into sequences of notes and chords.

LSTM-based sequence generation model.

Trains on a dataset of MIDI songs (classical/jazz/pop).
